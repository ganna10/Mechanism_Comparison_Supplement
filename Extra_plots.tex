In the paper, net radical and PAN family production budgets from alkane, alkene and aromatic degradation was analysed for all mechanisms. 
As the largest differences were due to alkane and aromatic degradation, the pentane and toluene production and loss budgets from each mechanism was attributed to the responsible processes. 
These processes are further broken down to the individual reactions. 

Figures \ref{f:pentane_radical} and \ref{f:toluene_radical} depict the reactions contributing to the radical family production and loss budgets of pentane and toluene degradation respectively. 
Whilst the reactions resposible for PAN family production and consumption are illustrated in Figure \ref{f:pentane_PAN} and Figure \ref{f:toluene_PAN}.
