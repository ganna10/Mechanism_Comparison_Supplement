All chemical mechanisms were adapted from their original format into the modularised KPP \citep{Damian:2002} format for use in the MECCA boxmodel \citep{Sander:2005} as modified by \citep{Butler:2011}.

The MCM v3.2 \citep{Jenkin:1997, Jenkin:2003, Saunders:2003, Bloss:2005, MCM_Site} is the reference mechanism and its approach to dry deposition, photolysis and peroxy radical--peroxy radical reactions were applied to all mechanisms. 

\subsection{Photolysis} \label{ss:photolysis}
Photolysis was parameterised as a function of the solar zenith angle following the MCM approach \citep{Saunders:2003}.
Species from reduced mechanisms with a direct counterpart in the \mbox{MCM v3.2} were assigned the corresponding MCM v3.2 photolysis rate parameter. 
Otherwise, the recommended rate parameter in the mechanism determined the appropriate MCM v3.2 photolysis rate parameter. 
In some cases, the MCM v3.2 photolysis rate parameter closest in magnitude to that specified by the mechanism was used.  
For example, the organic nitrate species ONIT in RACM2 has a photolysis rate parameter of \mbox{$1.96 \times 10^{-6}$ s$^{-1}$} that was compared to the MCM v3.2 organic nitrate photolysis rate parameters \mbox{(J$_{51}$ -- J$_{57}$)}. 
The rate parameter J$_{54}$ is the most similar in magnitude and was assigned as the ONIT photolysis rate parameter in RACM2.

Photolysis reactions of a species in reduced mechanisms were sometimes represented by more than one \mbox{MCM v3.2} photolysis reaction. 
The product yields of the original mechanism reactions were preserved using combinations of the MCM v3.2 rate parameters. 
For example, glyoxal photolysis described by \reactionref{r:GLY_hv_1} and \reactionref{r:GLY_hv_2} in RADM2.
\begin{reactionlist}
    \reactionitem{GLY + h$\nu$}{$0.13$ HCHO + $1.87$ CO + $0.87$ \ce{H2}}{new}{r:GLY_hv_1}
    \reactionitem{GLY + h$\nu$}{$0.45$ HCHO + $1.55$ CO + $0.8$ \ce{HO2} + $0.15$ \ce{H2}}{new}{r:GLY_hv_2}
\end{reactionlist} 
Whereas in the MCM v3.2, \reactionref{r:GLYOX_hv_1}, \reactionref{r:GLYOX_hv_2} and \reactionref{r:GLYOX_hv_3} are prescribed for glyoxal photolysis with the rates J$_{31}$, J$_{32}$ and J$_{33}$.
\begin{reactionlist}
    \reactionitem{GLYOX + h$\nu$}{$2$ CO + $2$ \ce{H2}}{new}{r:GLYOX_hv_1}
    \reactionitem{GLYOX + h$\nu$}{$2$ CO + $2$ \ce{HO2}}{new}{r:GLYOX_hv_2}
    \reactionitem{GLYOX + h$\nu$}{HCHO + CO}{new}{r:GLYOX_hv_3}
\end{reactionlist}
The product yields in \reactionref{r:GLY_hv_1} were retained using a photolysis rate parameter of \mbox{$0.87$ J$_{31}$ + $0.13$ J$_{32}$}, whilst for \reactionref{r:GLY_hv_2} the rate \mbox{$0.15$ J$_{31}$ + $0.45$ J$_{32}$ + $0.4$ J$_{33}$} was used.
\mbox{Table \ref{t:glyoxal_photolysis}} illustrates the product yield calculations.

Reactions of organic peroxy radicals (\ce{RO2}) with other organic peroxy radicals are divided into self (\ce{RO2 + RO2}) and cross (\ce{RO2} + R$^{\prime}$\ce{O2}) reactions. 
These reactions are typically represented in chemical mechanisms as bimolecular reactions which would cause ambiguities when implementing the tagging scheme. 
Namely, which tag to be used for the products of reactions between \ce{RO2} reactants having different tags. 
The MCM v3.2 approach to self and cross \ce{RO2} reactions (each \ce{RO2} species reacts with the pool of all other \ce{RO2} at a single uniform rate) is used to avoid such ambiguities. 
The MCM v3.2 approach represents \ce{RO2}--\ce{RO2} reactions as a pseudo-unimolecular reaction whose rate constant includes a factor `RO2' which is the sum of the mixing ratios of all organic peroxy radicals \citep{Saunders:2003}.

The pseudo-unimolecular reaction products and their yields were determined by one of two methods.
Firstly, by using the \ce{RO2 + RO2} reaction and halving the product yields, demonstrated for the MOZART-4 treatment of the ethyl peroxy radical in \mbox{Table \ref{t:RO2}}. 
Alternatively, the \ce{RO2 + CH3O2} reaction was used to determine the products due to \ce{CH3O2} and these products are then removed.

Table \ref{t:ETHP} demonstrates the steps determining the ETHP pseudo-unimolecular reaction in RACM2. 
First the products due to MO2 (\ce{CH3O2} in RACM2) are determined as outlined previously using the \mbox{MO2 + MO2} reaction. 
The MO2 product yields are subtracted from the \mbox{ETHP + MO2} reaction. 
Any products having a negative yield are not included in the final pseudo-unimolecular reaction.

The methyl acyl peroxy radical (\ce{CH3C(O)O2}) was the exception to the above approach. 
Although most mechanisms include a \mbox{\ce{CH3C(O)O2 + CH3C(O)O2}} reaction, the \ce{CH3C(O)O2} pseudo-unimolecular reaction was derived by subtracting the \ce{CH3O2} product yields from the \mbox{\ce{CH3C(O)O2 + CH3O2}} reaction. 
This approach was used as the \mbox{\ce{CH3C(O)O2 + CH3O2}} reaction is the most significant reaction for \ce{CH3C(O)O2}.

The rate constant for each pseudo-unimolecular reaction was taken as that of the \mbox{\ce{RO2 + CH3O2}} reaction multiplied by an `RO2' factor, which is the sum of the mixing ratios of all organic peroxy radicals. 
The \mbox{\ce{RO2 + CH3O2}} rate constant was chosen as this is the most likely reaction to occur. 

Model runs using the original and modified approach to the \ce{RO2}--\ce{RO2} reactions for each mechanism were performed.
The resulting \ce{O3} concentration time series were compared and shown in Figure \ref{f:O3_concentrations}.

\subsection{Dry Deposition}

Dry deposition velocities for individual chemical species are taken from the MCM v3.2. 
The MCM v3.2 dry deposition velocities of the same chemical functional group were used for mechanism species without direct MCM v3.2 analogues. 
For example, the dry deposition velocity of PAN-like species in all mechanisms was equivalent to that of the PAN species in the MCM v3.2.

\subsection{Negative Product Yield Treatment}

Some mechanisms include reactions where products have a negative yield. 
These reactions were re-written including an operator species with a positive yield as the analysis tools used in this study do not allow negative product yields. 
The operator species acts as a sink for the original product by immediately reacting with the original product generating a `NULL' product. 

For example, in RADM2 the OH + CSL (cresol) reaction has negative OH yield in \reactionref{r:CSL_OH} \citep{Stockwell:1990}.
\begin{reactionlist}
    \reactionitem{CSL + OH}{0.1 \ce{HO2} + 0.9 \ce{XO2} + 0.9 \ce{TCO3} - 0.9 OH}{new}{r:CSL_OH}
\end{reactionlist}
The negative OH yield was adapted to a positive operator (OHOP) yield in \reactionref{r:CSL_OHOP}.
OHOP then reacts immediately with OH giving a `NULL' product with a rate constant of \mbox{$8.0 \times 10^{-11}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$} \reactionref{r:OHOP_OH}. 
Thus preserving the OH yields from \reactionref{r:CSL_OH} in RADM2.
\begin{reactionlist}
    \reactionitem{CSL + OH}{0.1 \ce{HO2} + 0.9 \ce{XO2} + 0.9 \ce{TCO3} + 0.9 OHOP}{new}{r:CSL_OHOP}
    \reactionitem{OHOP + OH}{NULL}{new}{r:OHOP_OH}
\end{reactionlist}
